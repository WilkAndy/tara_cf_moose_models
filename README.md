# tara_cf_moose_models

MOOSE models to compare with and extend the LaForce et al semi-analytic solutions of nonisothermal fluid injection into a reservoir.

- LaForce, T. and Ennis-King, J. and Paterson, L., "Semi-analytical solutions for nonisothermal fluid injection including heat loss from the reservoir: Part 1. Saturation and temperature", Advances in Water Resources 73 (2014) 227--234, https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2014.08.008
- LaForce, T. and Mijic, A. and Ennis-King, J. and Paterson, L., "Semi-analytical solutions for nonisothermal fluid injection including heat loss from the reservoir: Part 2.  Pressure and stress", Advances in Water Resources 73 (2014) 242--253, https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2014.08.009

For Andy's reference: these models are mirrored in the private tara_cf github repo.
